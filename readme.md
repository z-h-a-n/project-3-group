##Welcome to Soar, an app that allows you to communicate and share while in the air!

Imagine that you are in the air and passing over a remote part of Venezuela. The cabin is a pressurized cell of fidgeting children and boundless boredom, and the thought strikes you that you would like to be somewhere else. In fact it has felt like you have spent the last 3 hours stationary, in the unchanging surroundings of the cabin. 
However you know that you have been travelling at over 800 kilometres per hour, over breathtaking views! So what is down there? What might you discover if you looked outside? Soar allows you to find out.

With our interactive map you can enter your flight path to find where you are going and then zoom under it to look at beautiful satellite images of the terrain that you are passing. Find a beautiful lake in a mountain range in Mongolia? You can drop a pin here and write a message for someone else that might pass, or attach a photograph of the beautiful sunrise that you saw above the clouds when you were cruising over the Pacific Ocean.

Now the journey will become just as interesting as the destination!
